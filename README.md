## üß™ Testing the System
- **Text input** ‚Üí type design requests, AI replies with summaries + voice.
- **Voice input** ‚Üí hold mic button and speak; words appear in textbox.
- **Wave animation** ‚Üí background waves move with AI‚Äôs speech.
- **Drag & drop** ‚Üí upload files into Bucket.
- **Build** ‚Üí click Build to package DXF+PDF+CSV+DOCX+ZIP.
- **Checklist** ‚Üí auto-updates based on current plan.

**OCR Panel Schedule Test:**
1. Drag panel photos into dropzone.
2. Call API:
   ```http
   POST /panel/ocr_to_excel
   {
     "files": null,

     "session": "<auto>"
   }
   ```
3. Download `panel_schedule_*.xlsx` from Outputs.
