You are ChatGPT, acting as a software engineer with electrical engineering and PE experience. 
I want you to generate a Replit-ready starter kit that helps me build an AI-powered engineer assistant. 

The kit should:
1. Include a drag-and-drop resource bucket where I can upload floor plans (DXF/DWG/PDF), equipment cut sheets, photos, and text notes.
2. Provide a voice/typed command interface so I can ask for outputs like one-line diagrams, power plans, lighting plans, and Revit task packages.
3. Generate deterministic DXF files using Python (with ezdxf) and structured JSON that can later be imported into Revit with Dynamo/pyRevit.
4. Be packaged as a Replit project, with `.replit`, `replit.nix`, `requirements.txt`, and all app code in FastAPI.

Enhancements for version 3:
- Add clear beginner-friendly documentation (`docs/GET_STARTED.md`) that explains step by step how to run the kit on Replit and use it even if I have no coding experience.
- Provide a checklist of required AI software and CAD/BIM tools (`docs/AI_SOFTWARE_CHECKLIST.md`).
- Provide a roadmap (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) showing phases from MVP â†’ client-ready outputs.
- Include a self-contained HTML presentation (`docs/presentation.html`) with a slide-deck style overview of how to use the starter kit and the roadmap.

Suggestions to make the kit even better:
- Add starter symbol blocks and layer naming conventions so DXFs look closer to production drawings.
- Integrate panel schedule CSV generation alongside the one-line diagram.
- Add optional OCR and PDF parsing helpers to extract data from cut sheets and notes uploaded to the resource bucket.
- Add a simple QA/QC pipeline (`app/utils/qaqc.py`) to check feeder ampacity, voltage drop, working clearances, etc., and return warnings in the UI.
- Create a Revit import script example in Dynamo/pyRevit that consumes the exported JSON task package.

Please generate this full starter kit as a downloadable zip file that I can upload to Replit, with all directories and code included.
